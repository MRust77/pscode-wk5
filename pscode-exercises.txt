// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. a= Input first number
2. b= Input second number
3. a+b= Sum
4. Display "the sum of", first number "and", second number "is", Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Input number
2. If number % 2 =0 then
   a. Display "the number is even"
3. Other,
   a. Display "the number is odd"

Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Input first number
2. Input second number
3. Input third number
4. Input fourth number 
5. Input fifth number
6. Set minimal and max to the first number entered
3. Set count to 0
4. Repeat the following steps 5 times:
   a. Read a number from the user and store it in a variable num
   b. Add num to sum
   c. If num is less than min, set min to num
   d. If num is greater than max, set max to num
   e. Increment count by 1
5. Calculate the average by dividing sum by 5
6. Display "The average of the five numbers is:", average
7. Display "The smallest number is:", min
8. Display "The largest number is:", max
